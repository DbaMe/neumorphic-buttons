- For the icons, use font awesome, or the images in the `images` folder

- Make sure to use the `transition` property for a smooth transition

- If you are not familiar with `svg` (Scalable Vector Graphics), here is a [good reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial)

- Neumorphism is a really hot design trend at the moment - check out [this guide](https://css-tricks.com/neumorphism-and-css/) for a thorough introduction

- As usual, try to make it as pixel-perfect as possible
